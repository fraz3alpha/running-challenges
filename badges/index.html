<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>

<p>There are many stats that parkrunners keep, and a few of these are obvious such
as the number of parkruns you have done, or how many different parkruns you have
been to, but there are also some more mysterious ones, such as the <em>p-index</em> or
ones that are hard to calculate such as the furthest distance from home you have
travelled to go to a parkrun. The Running Challenges extension currently calculates
the following stats:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Stat</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Description</th>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Total PBs<a id="total_pbs"></a></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The total number of PBs achieved across all parkruns. N.B. parkrun counts PBs on a per-event basis, not across all events. You are marked as a â€˜First Timerâ€™ the first time you visit a parkrun event, and the next time you visit that even you have the chance to get your first PB there.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Longest PB streak<a id="longest_pb_streak"></a></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The highest number of consecutive PBs achieved across all parkrun events.</td>

    </tr>

      <td style="text-align: center">wilson-index<a id="wilson_index"></a></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The maximum contiguous series of parkrun event numbers you have attended (at any event), starting at 1. To start off your streak, this requires that you have run at an inaugural event (controversial!), and then to increase the value to 2 you need to run at event #2 somewhere (not necessarily the same event as you ran at the inaugural event). They do not have to be in order, so you can go back and fill in numbers later.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">parkrun birthday<a id="parkrun_birthday"></a></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The day you joined the parkrun family! This is the day you completed your first parkrun. Unfortunately we canâ€™t find the date you first volunteered as this only takes into account your parkrun results table.</td>

      <td style="text-align: left">The cumulative distance you have travelled between each parkrun event. This is calculated by adding together the straight-line distance between each parkrun event in your results table. This is naturally going to be woefully inaccurate and is intended only to give a general guide for how much travel was required to go to the events in your results table.</td>

      <td style="text-align: left">The average latitude/longitude of all your parkrun attendances. This is the basic average of the lat/lon position of each parkrun result in your results table. If you commonly run only at your home parkrun and only occasionally visit other parkruns then the location will be heavily weighted towards your home parkrun. If, however, you visit all over the world, who knows where you will be on average - probably in the sea!</td>
