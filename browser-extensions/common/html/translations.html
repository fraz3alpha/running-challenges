<h3>Translations</h3>

<p>
  We think we have a full set of translations for all of the volunteer roles,
  and you can view them all in our <a href="https://github.com/fraz3alpha/running-challenges/blob/master/browser-extensions/common/js/lib/i18n.js">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you aren't being credited for a role, or have spotted one that is incorrect,
  feel free to send us an email with your athlete id and we will try and work out
  what needs changing.
