    <p>Your extension is broken, fix it, fix it, fix it!</p>

<h2 id="ive-been-living-under-a-rock-what-has-broken">I’ve been living under a rock, what has broken?</h2>

<p>On the 6th October 2021, parkrun started rolling out some changes to their website - this included moving the page that we add all the badges to and making it available at a different web address. The old page we used is still there, but it contains different data - so the extension doesn’t know what to do with it, and promptly spits out the helpful error: “Error Map container not found”.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-it-be-fixed">When will it be fixed?</h2>

<p>Soon. Probably in October.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rboyatt">Russell Boyatt</a> who contributed some code to get most things back working again. We are testing his <a href="https://github.com/fraz3alpha/running-challenges/pull/305">changes</a> at the moment. We’ve also tried to write some tests to automatically check the extension loads on each parkrun site, as that is incredibly tedious to check and no-one has got time for that…</p>

<p>Russell has also been busy getting the <a href="https://github.com/fraz3alpha/running-challenges/pull/308">changes</a> made to support the Austrian site that appeared recently, awesome work!</p>

<p>We have very little free time at the moment and it’s a non-trivial task to release a new version of the extension - even after all the code has been written, so please bear with us.</p>

<h2 id="i-would-like-to-know-whats-happening-with-the-extension-on-firefox-for-android">I would like to know what’s happening with the extension on Firefox for Android</h2>

<p>This is still not available. It’s because the browser has restricted the number of extensions to a very small, carefully vetted list of extensions that have millions of users that they can spend hours making sure they aren’t doing anything against their policies - as and when their security model means they can accept community-created extensions again we’ll try and get our extension listed once more.</p>

<h2 id="if-i-give-you-some-money-will-you-do-xyz">If I give you some money will you do XYZ</h2>

<p>No, that’s not really how it works. We did this for a bit of fun, and we aren’t taking any money for it. We’ll mostly do things as time allows and if we find it interesting - if you have some cash that is burning a hole in your pocket go to <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/shop/">the parkrun shop</a> and buy yourself something to support parkrun.</p>

<p>If you have a regular supply of burning-a-hole-in-your-pocket money, or you just want a warm fuzzy feeling of keeping parkrun around, why not sign up to <a href="https://parkrunforever.com/about/">parkrun Forever</a> and make a regular donation?</p>

<h2 id="any-progress-on-training-up-the-new-team-member">Any progress on training up the new team member?</h2>

<p>Progress has been made on standing, but not on Javascript.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-get-more-updates">How do I get more updates?</h2>

<p>It’s a lot easier to write a quick Tweet than post something on this website, so head over to our Twitter account - <a href="https://twitter.com/RunChallenges">@RunChallenges</a> for all the latest updates. You don’t need a Twitter account to read our recent updates, and it always best to check there first before asking us directly - we’ll generally put a post out as soon as we notice something is broken.</p>
