When you visit your parkrun results page, Running Challenges looks at your results
on the parkrun page you are viewing and adds your badges and progress tables to
the top of the page.

All your data is kept on the parkrun website and in your web browser (much the
same way as it is when you visit the webpage without the extension), no data is transmitted or stored anywhere else.
