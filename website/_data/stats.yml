stats:

  - shortname: total_runs
    name: Total Runs
    description: >-
      The total number of parkruns completed.

  - shortname: total_pbs
    name: Total PBs
    description: >-
      The total number of PBs achieved across all parkruns. N.B. parkrun counts
      PBs on a per-event basis, not across all events. You are marked as a
      'First Timer' the first time you visit a parkrun event, and the next time
      you visit that even you have the chance to get your first PB there.

  - shortname: longest_pb_streak
    name: Longest PB streak
    description: >-
      The highest number of consecutive PBs achieved across all parkrun events.

  - shortname: total_distance_ran
    name: Total parkrun distance
    description: >-
      The total distance achieved from adding up 5k for a parkrun, and 2k for a
      junior parkrun.

  - shortname: most_runs_in_a_year
    name: Most parkruns in a year
    description: >-
      The highest number of parkruns attended in a calendar year.

  - shortname: p_index
    name: p-index
    description: >-
      The number of parkruns that satisfy the equation 'p parkruns run at least
      p times', e.g. If you have run 4 different parkruns at least 4 times each,
      your p-index is 4. If you have never run at an event twice, then your p-index
      will only be 1!

  - shortname: wilson_index
    name: wilson-index
    description: >-
      The maximum contiguous series of parkrun event numbers you have attended
      (at any event), starting at 1. To start off your streak, this requires that
      you have run at an inaugural event (controversial!), and then to increase
      the value to 2 you need to run at event #2 somewhere (not necessarily the
      same event as you ran at the inaugural event). They do not have to be in
      order, so you can go back and fill in numbers later.

  - shortname: parkrun_birthday
    name: parkrun birthday
    description: >-
      The day you joined the parkrun family! This is the day you completed your
      first parkrun. Unfortunately we can't find the date you first volunteered
      as this only takes into account your parkrun results table.

  - shortname: years_parkrunning
    name: Years parkrunning
    description: >-
      The number of full years you have been going to parkrun since you completed
      your first event.

  - shortname: events_run
    name: Events run
    description: >-
      The number of different parkrun events you have completed.

  - shortname: tourist_quotient
    name: Tourist quotient
    description: >-
      The percentage of parkrun events attended that you had not been to before.
      If you never repeat a parkrun event it will be 100%, if you never tourist
      at all it will tend towards 0%.

  - shortname: tourism_streak
    name: Tourism streak
    description: >-
      The longest unbroken run of different events visited. If this happens to
      include your 'home' parkrun, this still counts in the calculation.

  - shortname: parkruns_this_year
    name: parkruns this year
    description: >-
      How many parkrun events you have completed during this calendar year.


  - shortname: total_distance_travelled
    name: Total distance travelled
    description: >-
      The cumulative distance you have travelled between each parkrun event.
      This is calculated by adding together the straight-line distance between
      each parkrun event in your results table. This is naturally going to be
      woefully inaccurate and is intended only to give a general guide for how
      much travel was required to go to the events in your results table.

  - shortname: total_countries_visited
    name: Total countries visited
    description: >-
      The total number of countries that you have parkrunned in.
      If everything is working this should match the number of flags under your
      badges!


  - shortname: average_parkrun_location
    name: Average parkrun location
    description: >-
      The average latitude/longitude of all your parkrun attendances.
      This is the basic average of the lat/lon position of each parkrun result in
      your results table. If you commonly run only at your home parkrun and only
      occasionally visit other parkruns then the location will be heavily weighted
      towards your home parkrun. If, however, you visit all over the world, who knows
      where you will be on average - probably in the sea!

  - shortname: average_parkrun_event
    name: Average parkrun event
    description: >-
      The closest parkrun event to your average parkrun location.
      In case you want to go run it.

  - shortname: furthest_travelled
    name: Furthest travelled
    description: >-
      The furthest away parkrun you have been to (calculated from the home parkrun
      configured in the extension's options).
      Note - this statistic is only available for the athlete configured in
      the extension options, as it needs to know which home parkrun to base
      the calculation from.

  - shortname: nearest_event_not_done_yet
    name: Nearest event not done yet (NENDY)
    description: >-
      The nearest parkrun event to your home parkrun that you have not done yet.
      Note - this statistic is only available for the athlete configured in
      the extension options, as it needs to know which home parkrun to base
      the calculation from.

  - shortname: total_volunteer_roles
    name: Total volunteer roles
    description: >-
      How many of the different volunteering roles have been completed.
      Note - this can include multiple roles per week e.g. if you were a marshal,
      did course setup, and close-down, that adds 3 to this stat.

  - shortname: paj/v-index
    name: v-index
    description: >-
      The number of volunteer roles which have been performed at least v times.
      E.g. If you have volunteered in 4 different roles at least 4 times, your
      v-index is 4. This stat was created by [Mel Erbacher](https://www.parkrun.com.au/results/athleteeventresultshistory/?athleteNumber=384152&eventNumber=0)
