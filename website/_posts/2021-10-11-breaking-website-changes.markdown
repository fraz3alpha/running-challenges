Your extension is broken, fix it, fix it, fix it!

## I've been living under a rock, what has broken?

On the 6th October 2021, parkrun started rolling out some changes to their website - this included moving the page that we add all the badges to and making it available at a different web address. The old page we used is still there, but it contains different data - so the extension doesn't know what to do with it, and promptly spits out the helpful error: "Error Map container not found".

## When will it be fixed?

Soon. Probably in October.

Many thanks to [Russell Boyatt](https://github.com/rboyatt) who contributed some code to get most things back working again. We are testing his [changes](https://github.com/fraz3alpha/running-challenges/pull/305) at the moment. We've also tried to write some tests to automatically check the extension loads on each parkrun site, as that is incredibly tedious to check and no-one has got time for that...

Russell has also been busy getting the [changes](https://github.com/fraz3alpha/running-challenges/pull/308) made to support the Austrian site that appeared recently, awesome work!

We have very little free time at the moment and it's a non-trivial task to release a new version of the extension - even after all the code has been written, so please bear with us.

## I would like to know what's happening with the extension on Firefox for Android

This is still not available. It's because the browser has restricted the number of extensions to a very small, carefully vetted list of extensions that have millions of users that they can spend hours making sure they aren't doing anything against their policies - as and when their security model means they can accept community-created extensions again we'll try and get our extension listed once more.

## If I give you some money will you do XYZ

No, that's not really how it works. We did this for a bit of fun, and we aren't taking any money for it. We'll mostly do things as time allows and if we find it interesting - if you have some cash that is burning a hole in your pocket go to [the parkrun shop](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/shop/) and buy yourself something to support parkrun.

If you have a regular supply of burning-a-hole-in-your-pocket money, or you just want a warm fuzzy feeling of keeping parkrun around, why not sign up to [parkrun Forever](https://parkrunforever.com/about/) and make a regular donation?

## Any progress on training up the new team member?

Progress has been made on standing, but not on Javascript.

## How do I get more updates?

It's a lot easier to write a quick Tweet than post something on this website, so head over to our Twitter account - [@RunChallenges](https://twitter.com/RunChallenges) for all the latest updates. You don't need a Twitter account to read our recent updates, and it always best to check there first before asking us directly - we'll generally put a post out as soon as we notice something is broken.
