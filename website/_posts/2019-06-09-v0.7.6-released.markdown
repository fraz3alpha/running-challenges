Full Ponty challenge extended and the addition of a new stat - the v-index!

## Full Ponty challenge

Back in April a new parkrun started in Bala, Wales, and it was officially named
as [Pont y Bala](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/pontybala/). This update includes the
Bala parkrun in the Full Ponty challenge that so many people love :)

## v-index stat

The p-index generated a lot of interest - and quite a bit of confusion, when it
was first introduced, so the v-index doubles the fun :) Instead of having to do
some parkrun tourism to improve your p-index, the v-index focuses on different
volunteering roles.

This was first mentioned by Mel in [Episode 158](https://parkrunadventurers.podbean.com/e/episode-158-v-index/)
of the [parkrun adventurers](https://www.facebook.com/parkrunadventurers/) podcast -
check it out!

It's all very simple, it is the number of different volunteering roles, v, that
you have done at least v times each.

Many thanks to [Pete Johns](https://github.com/johnsyweb) from Melbourne who
wrote the initial code to add this based on the p-index, and created a pull-request
in GitHub so we could included it - Nice one!

## How do I get all of this great stuff?

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon - typically we
have found it takes a few days for Chrome and Firefox to auto-update, but it should
do so eventually.  If you haven't yet joined the fun you can get it from one of
the links below. :
