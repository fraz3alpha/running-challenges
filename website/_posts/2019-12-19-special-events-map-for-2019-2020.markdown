It's that time of the year for the extra festive parkrun events!

We were a bit late to the game and have missed the Thanksgiving extras,
but there is still change to find your local event that is doing the 
Christmas Day/Eve/Boxing Day or New Year's Day parkruns!


See [the map here]({{ site.baseurl }}/map), and there is another link at the top
of this page.

As with last year, you can filter on the time as well as the day, so you can find
the closest event to you that gets you the amount of sleep you like :)

We think we've got all the countries, and have listed them under their English 
translations, so you'l find Christmas Eve in Denmark and Boxing Day in Germany.
Hopefully we've got them translated right!

If you are interested in a New Year's Day Double, don't forget [Rikki Princeâ€™s](https://twitter.com/rikkiprince)
amazing [Double Finder Tool](https://tailrun.uk/nyd/2020/) to see which ones you
might be able to do!
