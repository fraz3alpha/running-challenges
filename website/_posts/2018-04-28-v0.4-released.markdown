Now including Malaysia!

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon, if not you can get it
from the [Chrome WebStore]({{ site.data.webstore.webstore-running-challenges-link }}) today!

This version now supports Malaysia (at least to the extent that [parkrun.my](https://parkrun.my) works).

We now have a flag for Malaysia, which is what most people would have seen was missing.
We have not provided the links on the [parkrun.my](https://parkrun.my) site
though as the 'All Results' page does not work - therefore there is no point
trying to link to it.
